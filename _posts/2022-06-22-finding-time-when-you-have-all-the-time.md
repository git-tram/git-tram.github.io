Procrastination is something that everyone experiences. You may put off a task because it’s daunting or hard, but you always end up doing it because you have to. Yet, what about procrastination for something you enjoy?

I have been experiencing this problem lately. I have all the time in the world, yet I don’t want to engage with the things that make me happy. There is always the possibility that I don’t like these things. But, it seems wrong and there is another answer.

Why do I find fulfilment in my education but not in my hobbies? Having goals creates fulfilment for me and I desire to succeed in these goals. This is what keeps me interested and explains my disinterest in my hobbies. Although, this seems wrong too. Why can I not relax? Why do I need something to achieve? Is this an unhealthy mindset to have?

But, is there anything without a goal? Short or long-term, it does not matter. Filling up a glass of water to drink, is that a goal? Cooking dinner for your family, is this also a goal? If all things are goals, then why do I procrastinate on them? Thus, my prior reasoning is wrong.

I do not know why I procrastinate, I just do. Is it wrong to procrastinate if you end up achieving the task anyway? Perhaps, procrastination is relaxation, a certain forced downtime in preparation for work. This may be true in things you achieve adequately, but what about in things you fail? Is there “good” and “bad” procrastination, or is it just relaxation?

Yet, relaxation feels relaxing. While the proposed “good” procrastination is a lingering feeling, not good or bad, but present. Then “bad” procrastination is the lingering negative feelings of self-doubt. That may be the difference, experienced feeling from thought, but the same avoidance.

Then how do you change “bad” procrastination to “good”? How do you change self-doubt into self-belief? It is a psychological change that requires facilitation from yourself or others. Someone to push you to be better, that someone may be yourself. Changing “bad” to “good” procrastination changes your mindset. This mindset leads to more positive changes, where you may end up not procrastinating at all.
