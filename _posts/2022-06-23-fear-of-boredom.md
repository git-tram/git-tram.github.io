Most people regard boredom as something to run from. Yet, they should embrace this fear. Being stuck in a situation that you think is boring should raise questions. Why am I bored?

Do I find the material, place, or person boring? Do I know too much or too little? Do not ignore these questions, but ponder.

Boredom is the flame to a candle, an ignition of thinking and questioning of your psyche. You may find the answer to boredom in this questioning. Which will lead to a better understanding of yourself.

But why do we have an instinctual fear of boredom? Why do we preoccupy ourselves with meaningless things in avoidance? Fear comes from danger, but does boredom too?

Say for example you are talking to an acquaintance and the conversation starts to dwindle. You feel the entanglement of boredom around your feet and you want to run. This fear prompts you to change topics or leave all together. Yet, is there any danger?

No, there is only imagined danger. It may be your insecurities blocking you from fulfilment and interest. Boredom is not a reflection of the other but yourself. In your reflection only you can see your impurities and you focus on them.

Thus, boredom is the defence of the psyche. Only in acknowledgement of this imagined danger can the person experience interest.
