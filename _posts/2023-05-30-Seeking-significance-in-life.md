It is hard to put into words what life is. Can you define meaning from existence if that existence continues without you? Or is existence individual? If you frame existence as personal, you could value your significance. If existence is plural, existence is not dependent on you. Although, the plurality of existence does not mean the end of your significance, as you will always have an impact. It is unquantifiable to measure significance, but framing existence as individual versus plural highlights the question of which is the most ideal. 

An individual existence seems lonely. Do you think it is imperative to have a connection with others? Or that this connection is the basis for lifeâ€™s significance? Relationships are indeed necessary for ideal functioning, why then is it not ideal to be devoid of connection? You could say that connection facilitates life, an ever-dynamic forward momentum. I like to think in terms of experiences, which form clusters; these clusters form the building blocks for what we constitute as a person. Clusters are heavily dependent on others, but they are not the only materials. It is possible to learn from the self, but this self depends on the world. To say then that you are a more informed person by relating to others would be true. It is also true that you are more informed by relating to yourself. The individual perspective may give preference to self-relation, and this may be significant. 

A total understanding of yourself would constitute life significance. Maybe so that someone who has been forever isolated would see the significance in their self-understanding. They cannot deem significance as a plurality. This life individuality may have its benefits. You do not view yourself with others. You will always view yourself linearly, from past to future. Significance is then positive or negative, the more self-understanding builds your clusters of experience; these clusters then garner some form of significance. You may compare your prior selves to the current, this is the basis of change, which is significant. 

To view yourself with others, a plurality, seems irresponsible. Although, it is an innate thing in the social world. Plurality is not necessarily a bad thing; it just is easily detrimental. You can have significance from others, I would say this is the most common form of significance. Yet, to completely disregard plurality because of its negativity seems wrong. Ideally, a combination of individuality and plurality is the most ideal. In saying that, it would be heavily context-based, and the perspective will change. However, individuality and plurality may work as a function of progress. 

You could say that it is essential to have an individual frame established before you move to plurality. You should be able to find significance in yourself before you relate to others. This foundation allows someone to deal with the negativity of plurality. In doing so, you build significance at two levels, individual and plural, which may provide you with a multitude of facets into your life significance.
